Built in Node.js from the ground-up from its [Python ancestor](https://github.com/hyperfresh/CAutomator-Legacy), CAutomator can control custom roles for each user to help users stand out, manage server-side profile cards to help users with IRL identity, find the time and weather across the globe, and manage invites into the server. 

## Feature spotlight: Profile system

A common problem within the Calculated Anarchy server is IRL identities. CAutomator fixes this problem with the **CAutomator Profile System**.

![Profile system example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/822673098637574184/823117284741611550/unknown.png?width=346&height=585)

The CAutomator profile system is able to show the user's IRL name, pronouns, birthday, Switch friend code, pride badges and interests. It also has the ability to show the user's time and time zone, as well show a brief "about me"!

There's more features to learn about! Have a look at https://hyperfresh.github.io/CAutomator for more details.
