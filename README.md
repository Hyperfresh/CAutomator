# About CAutomator
**CAutomator (JavaScript)** is a custom-built bot for Calculated Anarchy. It manages custom roles, server-side profile cards, and several other things.

# CAutomator comes in two versions
CAutomator was coded in Python originally, before it was rewritten in JavaScript. The Python code lives as "CAutomator Legacy". Although older, it is more stable (NOT reliable!) than CAutomator JS.

## What are the differences?
**CAutomator Legacy** is tried and tested to Python. It's a stable bot that does things almost flawlessly.

**CAutomator (JavaScript)** is the fresh new version built on what the web is using now: JavaScript. It has many more features and is expected to be more stable and reliable compared to Python when rewriting is complete.

Keep in mind that **CAutomator Legacy** is licensed under the [GNU **Lesser** GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html), while **CAutomator (JavaScript)** is licensed under the [GNU **Affero** GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). The main difference between the two licenses is that if you use **CAutomator (JavaScript)**, you MUST make your modified source code available for viewing if you decide to fork this repository and host a Discord bot with it.
