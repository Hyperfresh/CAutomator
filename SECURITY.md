## Reporting a Vulnerability

This GitHub repo automatically scans for vulnerabilities within the code and within node packages it depends on.

For vulnerabilities that GitHub *doesn't* pick up, liteally, just open an issue and @Hyperfresh.
I'll hopefully see the issue, but if you feel like I'm taking too long, then you can reach me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hyperfresh8080) as well.
I try my best to resolve the security issue, but if it can't be resolved, it's most likely because a dependency is being stubborn and not updating.
In that case, it'd be nice if you can help me find a more viable alternative to the problematic dependency.
