## Reporting a Vulnerability

Liteally, just open an issue and @Hyperfresh.
I'll hopefully see the issue, but if you feel like I'm taking too long, then you can reach me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hyperfresh8080) as well.
I try my best to resolve the security issue, but if it can't be resolved, it's most likely because a dependency is being stubborn and not updating.
In that case, fall back to the Legacy version, or help me find an alternative to the problematic dependency.
