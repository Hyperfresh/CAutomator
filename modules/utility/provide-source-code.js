/* 
                        PLEASE READ THIS FIRST.

    This command provides a user with the latest commit of CAutomator
    as seen on https://github.com/hyperfresh/CAutomator, as well as
    zipping ALL FILES WITHIN THIS BOT (if it has changed since cloning)
    and providing it to the user in a private DM.

    This command also depends with the 'zip-source.sh' file located at
    the root of CAutomator.

    As stated in Chapter 13 in the AGPL, which CAutomator is licensed on,
    you are to provide users with the source code if you have modified
    the code. This command allows that to happen by providing both the 
    original source code, and your modified source code if available,
    complying with this requirement.

    UNLESS you have read the LICENSE file, and you know what you're doing,
    you should NOT MODIFY this command NOR the 'zip-source.sh' file. Leave
    this file alone to comply with AGPL requirements.

                    READ THE ABOVE BEFORE PROCEEDING.
